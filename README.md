# EMPLOYEEDB
The primary purpose of this application is to allow employees to manage their own information. The employee enters a screen that displays all employee information, including ID, FirstName, LastName, Address, and Department. Next, he can add new employee information. Upon selecting insert, data is transferred to the MySQL database and from there, the table in the application is immediately updated. Additionally, he has the option to modify and delete employees as needed. Any modifications made are immediately reflected in the MySQL database. So, I created a MYSQL database named daproject that contains a table titled employees that was connected to my application. Data from the scene builder was also displayed in the table of my application. For designing scene builder is utilized.
